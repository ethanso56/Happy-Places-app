# Happy-Places-app
An app that allow you to store places that you want to remember.

Things I learnt-

- using third party libraries such as Dexter
- swipping capabilities
- sqlite and databases
- passing whole objects from one activity to another (Serializable vs Parcalable)
- using the Google Maps API
- getting the user's location
